# The Pegasus profiler

*Spain, P.F., D.L. Dorson and H.T. Rossby.  PEGASUS:  A simple, acoustically tracked velocity profiler.  Deep-Sea Res., 28, 1553-1567, 1981.*

The Pegasus principle of operation is very straightforward: As it sinks and ascends it measures the travel time of acoustic pings from bottom beacons (or round-trip travel times to transponders). From those slant distances together with its depth (from pressure) we can determine from its trajectory the strength of the currents at all depths. Originally developed to study the Somali Current in 1979, it was used in a number of studies in the 1980s.

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The RAFOS float principle of operation: As it drifts at depth it listens for and records the arrival times of precisely timed signals from moored sound sources. At end of mission the float surfaces and transmits to a satellite all data it has collected, pressure and temperature too. Knowing the speed of sound in sea water, the arrival times give us the float’s distance to the sources from which its position can be determined. Navigational accuracy ~3 km (depends on many factors).</p>
