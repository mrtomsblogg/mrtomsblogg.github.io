# The Pegasus profiler
![Pegasus Profiler](/assets/PegasusProfiler.png)
*Spain, P.F., D.L. Dorson and H.T. Rossby.  PEGASUS:  A simple, acoustically tracked velocity profiler.  Deep-Sea Res., 28, 1553-1567, 1981.*
<p><br>The Pegasus principle of operation is very straightforward: As it sinks and ascends it measures the travel time of acoustic pings from bottom beacons (or round-trip travel times to transponders). From those slant distances together with its depth (from pressure) we can determine from its trajectory the strength of the currents at all depths. Originally developed to study the Somali Current in 1979, it was used in a number of studies in the 1980s.</p>

# The RAFOS float

<p>The RAFOS float principle of operation: As it drifts at depth it listens for and records the arrival times of precisely timed signals from moored sound sources. At end of mission the float surfaces and transmits to a satellite all data it has collected, pressure and temperature too. Knowing the speed of sound in sea water, the arrival times give us the float’s distance to the sources from which its position can be determined. Navigational accuracy ~3 km (depends on many factors).</p>

# The acoustic Doppler current profiler

<p>The ADCP transmits short acoustic pulses along four beams. The sound is reflected back at various depths primarily by zooplankton. The Doppler shifts gives velocity along each of the four beams. These can be transformed in u, v, w velocities relative to the ship. Water velocity is obtained after subtracting the ship’s velocity (from GPS). We have operated ADCPs on three ships for years and even decades (the Oleander).</p>

# Scanning the ocean with ADCPs

<p>Starting in the early 1990s Charlie Flagg at Stony Brook University and I started a project to study the Gulf Stream and surrounding waters from the Oleander, a container vessel in weekly service between Bermuda and New Jersey. Mounted in the ship’s hull the ADCP profiles currents along the route.</p>

<p>In 1999 we teamed up with Prof. Martin Mork at the University of Bergen to operate an ADCP on the Nuka Arctica, a container vessel operating between Nuuk in Greenland and Aalborg in Denmark. In 2006 we installed an ADCP on the high-seas ferry Norröna. She operates out of the Faroes to Denmark and Iceland. We have learned so much from these operations.</p>
