Little retreats in the backyard are popular in Sweden. In summer 2020 I imported <a href="www.grastorpstugan.se" target="_blank">this octagon kit</a>. I might hang out here to read or do some work, but mostly just to dream, play sudoku, watch the squirrels play, and sometimes get a brief glimpse of a fox or coyote. I have yet to see a bobcat. This picture was taken by my Swedish friend Pernilla Frazier. She is an interior decorator and everything you see here is thanks to her!</p> <BR CLEAR=LEFT> You can find some biographical notes about me <a href="https://web.uri.edu/gso/meet/h-thomas-rossby/" target="_blank">here</a>.
