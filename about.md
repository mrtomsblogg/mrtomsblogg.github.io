# About page

Little retreats in the backyard are popular in Sweden. In summer 2020 I imported this octagon kit from: www.grastorpstugan.se/. I might hang out here to read or do some work, but mostly just to dream, play sudoku, watch the squirrels play, and sometimes get a brief glimpse of a fox or coyote. I have yet to see a bobcat. This picture was taken by my Swedish friend Pernilla Frazier. She is an interior decorator and everything you see here is thanks to her!
