<p style="padding: 0 2em 0 0">Little retreats in the backyard are popular in Sweden. In summer 2020 I imported <a href="http://www.grastorpstugan.se" target="_blank">this octagon kit</a>. I might hang out here to read or do some work, but mostly just to dream, play sudoku, watch the squirrels play, and sometimes get a brief glimpse of a fox or coyote. I have yet to see a bobcat. This picture was taken by my Swedish friend Pernilla Frazier. She is an interior decorator and everything you see here is thanks to her! I thank Laura Glastra for helping me set up this blog page. It wouldn't have happened otherwise! </p>  

<p style="padding: 0 2em 0 0">You can find some biographical notes about me <a href="https://web.uri.edu/gso/meet/h-thomas-rossby/" target="_blank">here</a>, where if you click on 'website' you will also find two articles I translated. One is a Norwegian account of an expedition to Greenland in 1923 that my father took part it in. It must have been a rather harrowing experience for their vessel was close to getting crushed while they drifted in dense ice for two months. The other article gives the reader a vivid account for why Swedes care so much about the Gulf Stream!
