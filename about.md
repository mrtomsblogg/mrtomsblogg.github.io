# About page

Little retreats in the backyard are popular in Sweden. In summer 2020 I imported [this octagon kit](www.grastorpstugan.se). I might hang out here to read or do some work, but mostly just to dream, play sudoku, watch the squirrels play, and sometimes get a brief glimpse of a fox or coyote. I have yet to see a bobcat. This picture was taken by my Swedish friend Pernilla Frazier. She is an interior decorator and everything you see here is thanks to her!  

You can find some biographical notes about me [here](https://web.uri.edu/gso/meet/h-thomas-rossby/).
