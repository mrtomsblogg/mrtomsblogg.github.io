<p style="padding: 0 2em 0 0">Little retreats in the backyard are popular in Sweden. In summer 2020 I imported <a href="http://www.grastorpstugan.se" onclick="window.open('www.grastorpstugan.se') target="_blank">this octagon kit</a>. I might hang out here to read or do some work, but mostly just to dream, play sudoku, watch the squirrels play, and sometimes get a brief glimpse of a fox or coyote. I have yet to see a bobcat. This picture was taken by my Swedish friend Pernilla Frazier. She is an interior decorator and everything you see here is thanks to her!</p>
