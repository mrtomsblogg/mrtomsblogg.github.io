All oceans have ‘Gulf Streams’ or western boundary currents as they are known because they all
flow along the western margins of oceans. These include the Gulf Stream off the US east coast,
the Brazil Current in the South Atlantic, the Agulhas Current in the Indian Ocean, and the
Kuroshio and East Australia Currents in the North and South Pacific oceans, respectively.
Regardless of where they are, they all flow poleward, i.e. toward higher latitudes. In so doing
they close the loop on the ocean-wide gyres driven by the trades that blow from east to west at
tropical latitudes and the westerlies that blow from west to east at mid-latitudes. Given that the
wind systems never stop blowing, not even in glacial times, so must these currents always flow.
So why is it that people worry about the ‘shut-down’ of the Gulf Stream and the climate changes
that might follow? It’s an interesting story.

Unlike all other western boundary currents, the Gulf Stream has an additional exclusive function
as the pipeline for all warm water flowing from low to high latitudes in the north Atlantic. We
know this because everywhere else across the Atlantic and at almost all depths flow is
equatorward. As such the Gulf Stream is an essential link in the Atlantic meridional overturning
circulation (or AMOC for short) whereby warm salty water is transported to high latitudes,
roughly half to south of Iceland and the other half to farther north into the Nordic Seas and the
Arctic. This northern branch of the Gulf Stream, what we call the North Atlantic Current, plays
an important role in moderating the climate of central and northern Europe. As it flows north it
loses heat to the atmosphere keeping the winds warm as they blow across the Atlantic. It is the
possibility of this AMOC portion of the Gulf Stream shutting down that is of concern. How
might that happen?

The customary view is that fresh water melting from Greenland might dilute the North Atlantic
Current water to the point where it can no longer sink even when cooled to the freezing point. If
it can’t sink and flow back into the deep North Atlantic, then new warm salty water can’t flow
north to replace the outflow and with the result that the system shuts down. No warm water
means no warm atmosphere and the winds over Europe turn cold. This is what people worry
about. But how likely is this and more importantly can it be predicted or anticipated? Most
oceanographers agree that for the foreseeable future this is unlikely. The reason is that freshwater
melt from Greenland tends to flow along its coast into and south along the Labrador coast where
it comes close to but makes only limited contact with the North Atlantic Current. This is
important for it allows one branch of the North Atlantic Current to reach the Nordic Seas with
little dilution. The other branch circulates clockwise in a large gyre southwest of Iceland known
as the Irminger Sea. These waters cool and sink to 1000-2000 m at most.

The Nordic Seas branch of the North Atlantic Current has been studied in detail for more than a
century, longer than any other. Thanks to these early efforts we know with considerable
confidence that it has remained stable with little variation over time. If anything given that the
waters are warmer today, heat transport may be greater today than 100 years ago. We do know
that it was shut down during glacial times but since the end of the last glacial event, the Younger
Dryas, about 11,000 years ago has been flowing without interruption. It has always seemed a bit
counterintuitive that in the midst of global warming the high latitude North Atlantic and northern
Europe would enter a cooling period. All the evidence we have today suggests the opposite:

Temperatures in Europe, Scandinavia and the Artic are increasing faster than almost anywhere
else on our planet. The Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current may be playing a role in these
developments by keeping the ocean warm.
