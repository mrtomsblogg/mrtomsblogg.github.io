*Spain, P.F., D.L. Dorson and H.T. Rossby.  PEGASUS:  A simple, acoustically tracked velocity profiler.  Deep-Sea Res., 28, 1553-1567, 1981.*

The Pegasus principle of operation is very straightforward: As it sinks and ascends it measures the travel time of acoustic pings from bottom beacons (or round-trip travel times to transponders). From those slant distances together with its depth (from pressure) we can determine from its trajectory the strength of the currents at all depths. Originally developed to study the Somali Current in 1979, it was used in a number of studies in the 1980s.
